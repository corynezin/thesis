Abstract

}
Neural networks have recently been found vulnerable to ``attacks'' which cause them to misclassify samples given a very small disturbance.  Attacks based on iterative gradient methods have been largely studied for continous domain samples like images.  In this work we introduce a hybrid algorithm for the non-continous domain of text.  Our algorithm uses gradient as a guide for candidate word replacements, and then performs an exponential search to determine the minimum number of replacements required to alter the classification of a text sample.  We test the algorithm under white box, gray box, and black box scenarios
