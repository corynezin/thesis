\noindent
First and foremost I thank my adviser, Professor Fred Fontaine.  Professor Fontaine has served as an excellent adviser in all my time as an electrical engineering student.  He has shown fierce dedication to his field, The Cooper Union, and of his students.  His signal processing course allowed me to discover a vast and interesting field, and he inspired me to pursue it.  This thesis would not be possible without his advisement and education which he provided me over the past two years.  I will not soon forget what I learned in his courses, nor the opportunities afforded as a result. \\

\noindent
I would like to thank all of my peers, the faculty, the alumni, and the administration, The Cooper Union as a whole.  This is a weird, beautiful, and sometimes pain inducing institution.  I feel that the sense of community is perhaps greater than any other place.  I hope that I will continue to be a part of the community for a long time so I can give back what The Cooper Union has given to me.  I give particular thanks to Brenda So, Ross Kaplan, and Gordon Macshane, some of the closest friends I made here.  They have helped me in ways I cannot even describe.\\

\noindent
Finally, I thank my parents.  They have always provided me support, and allowed me to grow to be my own person.  My intense work has reduced the time that I can spend with them, but I know they understand that this sacrafice is worth it.
