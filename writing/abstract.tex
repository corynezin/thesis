Neural networks have recently been found vulnerable to ``attacks'' which cause them to misclassify samples given a very small disturbance.  Attacks based on iterative gradient methods have been largely studied for continuous domain samples like images.  In this work two algorithms are introduced.  One algorithm, window search does not require a continuous or differentiable model.  The other is a hybrid algorithm which exploits gradient for fast search.  The hybrid algorithm uses the gradient as a guide for candidate word replacements, and then performs an exponential search to determine the minimum number of replacements required to alter the classification of a text sample.  The algorithm is tested under white box, gray box, and black box scenarios
